I purchased SEVERAL of these shirts for my husband who is a General Contractor who can never keep his shirts tucked in.  He's not super tall either, he's right at 6' but has a longer torso and I was hoping these shirts would be significantly longer than normal but they aren't.  But on the other hand, the quality is SUPERIOR!!!"},

Feels extremely durable (and a hair stiffer than a normal T-shirt).  Stitching heavyweight.  Pocket placement and size are as expected.  I own 4 of these in various colors (bought two initially, then two more since I was so impressed).  One of the few easy options for Tall sizes."},

I reckon a different weight. If you wear a 2XL buy a XL. They run a little large. Nice shirt, I just wanted one a little thicker."},

I am 6'3\" 195 lbs.. The first two I ordered several months ago in large tall, due to the reviews here saying they run long and large. That turned out to be true. I would normally order at least x-large tall but these fit just fine. I decided to order two more in different colors last week and the large tall were no longer available. I went ahead and ordered the regular Large but not in tall. I really can't see a lot of difference in the large/tall and the large/regular. The regular are also long in the sleeves and
